springsecuritybyeazybytes_1:   user name password is in Application.properties and all URL is Authanticated

springsecuritybyeazybytes_2:   user name password is in Application.properties and custome URL Authanticated

springsecuritybyeazybytes_3:   user name password is in InMemoryUserDetailsManager and custome URL Authanticated
                               InMemoryUserDetailsManager in this way we can add more then one user


springsecuritybyeazybytes_3b:  user name password is on serve in users table, used JdbcUserDetailsManager but 
                               JdbcUserDetailsManager is note good for production besd application  because it is not scalable
                               the fild of Users table is already defined, we can not change of modifie it.
                               ** Now in same project created own custom customer table and own logic to login 
                               by customer table, not Users table.
